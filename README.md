Code Refactor

The goal of this project was to take existing code and refactor it to make it accessesible to viewers with disabilites, and also to help the page rank higher in search engines. 

I took the existing code and refactored the html to follow semantic html rules, also making changes to the css to make sure it complies with the refactored html.
